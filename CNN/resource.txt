Dense() :
    Dense implements the operation: output = activation(dot(input, kernel) + bias) 
    where activation is the element-wise activation function passed as the activation
    argument, kernel is a weights matrix created by the layer, and bias is a bias vector
    created by the layer (only applicable if use_bias is True). These are all attributes
    of Dense.
